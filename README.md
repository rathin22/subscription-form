# Subscription-form

Front end created using ReactJS, REST API created with Express, and subcriptions stored in Firebase.

## Running the application:
You will need two terminals to run the application, one to start the React application, and one to run the server.

Open a terminal in both the client and server folders and run ```npm install```, followed by ```npm start``` in both.

This should automatically open http://localhost:3000/ and you will see the subscription form.
